# WeeklySeedPlugin

This Plugin is made for the Hytale Speedrunning Weekly Seed event.

# Features:

- All dimensions including fragments have the same set seed.
- Standardizes chest loot to be seed dependant.
- Standardizes mob drops to be seed dependant.
- Play with seed & offset of your choice

The offset is used to offset to offset the seed by some amount for the loot standardization, this is to guarantee good loot in the weekly seed event.

If you want to play with a set seed and set offset other than the weekly seed & offset. You can name your world "seed offset", an example of this is ``20 30`` where the seed is 20 and offset is 30.
